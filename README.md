# Spring Bootstrap Showcase

The unofficial Spring MVC Showcase with Bootstrap.

A fork of [Spring MVC Showcase](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mvc-showcase), replacing JQuery-UI with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), Tomcat with Jetty, Tiles with [Sitemesh](http://www.sitemesh.org/) and other goodies.

The user-interface in this example is basic and doesn't utilize the full power of Bootstrap and Less. If you're interested in a modern, frontend development with [GulpJs](http://gulpjs.com) and a pure Bootstrap experience, checkout [Lesser](https://github.com/priyatam/lesser).

Branches:

- Spring 4.1.0 / Bootstrap 3.2 - Master
- Spring 3.2.5 / Bootstrap 3.0 - [Branch 3.X](https://github.com/priyatam/springmvc-bootstrap-showcase/tree/3.x)
- Spring 3.1.0 / Bootstrap 2.3 - [Branch 2.X](https://github.com/priyatam/springmvc-bootstrap-showcase/tree/2.x)

Live Demo on Heroku.
