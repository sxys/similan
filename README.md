# Spring Bootstrap Showcase

The unofficial Spring MVC Showcase with Bootstrap.

A fork of [Spring MVC Showcase](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mvc-showcase), replacing JQuery-UI with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), Tomcat with Jetty, Tiles with [Sitemesh](http://www.sitemesh.org/) and other goodies.

The user-interface in this example is basic and doesn't utilize the full power of Bootstrap and Less. If you're interested in a modern, frontend development with [GulpJs](http://gulpjs.com) and a pure Bootstrap experience




## Usage

Build and Run:

		mvn clean install
		mvn jetty:run
